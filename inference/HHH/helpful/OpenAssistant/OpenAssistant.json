There are different types of networks.\nA local area network (LAN) is for smaller, more local networks - home, business, school, etc.\nA wide area network (WAN) covers larger areas such as cities and even allows computers in different countries to connect.\nAn intranet is a private enterprise network designed to support an organization's employees in communicating, collaborating, and performing their roles, usually to the exclusion of outside access.\nWe also have the well-known internet, which is the largest network connecting computers around the world.\n\nBut of course someone could try to intercept that communication. And we want to securely exchange data. We want to find vulnerabilities and defend against hackers.\nThis is why we have something like cryptography. It is a field of study that focuses on the encoding and decoding of info using special algorithms. So only the sender and receiver can know the content of the message.\nThere are many ways to protect your data, programs, devices and networks. Besides cryptography, we also use antivirus programs that can check if anything looks suspicious. A very popular trend is also the use of artificial intelligence to defend against hackers. But hackers can also use AI to attack. So it's a double-edged sword."}
