### üíÅFor each folder, the bash scripts are examples of "facebook/opt" family.

If you want to change your model such as EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b, you may simply update
``` --actor_model_name_or_path ${step1_path} --critic_model_name_or_path ${step2_path} ```.

If you don't have step 1 and step 2 models. You may simply try
``` bash
--actor_model_name_or_path facebook/opt-1.3b --critic_model_name_or_path facebook/opt-350m
```
‚ö°‚ö°‚ö° When you use above script, please make sure you modify parameter `rlhf_training` to False when calling the `create_critic_model` function twice in [rlhf_engine.py](./../../step3_rlhf_finetuning/rlhf_engine.py) such that it won't load the model weight from previous paths.

For the models we support, please see [our landing page](./../../../README.md#-supported-models-)
